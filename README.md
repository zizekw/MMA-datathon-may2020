# Rotman Summer Datathon (Team H)

![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)

Welcome to our dashboard app! We are a group of students at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. We're participating in the first ever Rotman Summer Datathon as Team H. Thanks to our industry partner [Stathletes](https://www.stathletes.com/), we've been given a dataset on the 2018 Olympic Hockey tournament. Team H intends to specifically analyze the Canadian Women's Hockey Team data to identify top performers in the 2018 tournament to help prepare for the next upcoming tournament. 

## Objective

This dashboard serves to model key performance metrics and visualize performance behaviour to better inform offensive strategy. We will recommend 5 outstanding players: 3 goal scorers and 2 passers where 2 of the aforementioned players will be a faceoff specialist and one being a takeaway specialist.
